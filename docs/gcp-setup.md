# AeroLab on GCP

## Prerequisites

The `gcloud` SDK is required in order to configure authentication to the `GCP` account to be used with AeroLab.

To install the `gcloud` SDK, follow [this manual](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

Once the SDK has been installed, authenticate on the computer using `gcloud auth application-default login`. AeroLab will automatically use the credentails generated by the `gcloud` command.

### Configure the GCP backend with AeroLab

The most basic configuration is:

```bash
aerolab config backend -t gcp -o project-name
```

To specify a custom location where SSH keys are stored and override the
default AWS region configuration, extra parameters may be supplied:

```bash
aerolab config backend -t gcp -o project-name -p /PATH/TO/KEYS [-d /path/to/tmpdir/for-aerolab/to/use]
```

## Deploy an Aerospike cluster in GCP

Extra parameters are required when working with the `gcp` backend as opposed to the `docker` backend.

Executing `aerolab cluster create help` once the backend has been selected displays the relevant options.

### Examples:

#### Basic cluster with 20GB root volume and 2x 40GB ssd volumes

```bash
aerolab cluster create -n testcluster -c 3 -m mesh --instance e2-medium --zone us-central1-a --disk balanced:20 --disk ssd:40 --disk ssd:40
```

#### Lock security-groups so that machines are only accessible from the AeroLab IP address:

```bash
aerolab config gcp lock-firewall-rules
```

#### Lock security-groups so that machines are only accessible from a given IP range:

```bash
aerolab config gcp lock-firewall-rules --ip 1.2.3.4/32
```

### Destroy cluster:
```bash
aerolab cluster destroy -n testcluster
```

#### Destroy aerolab-managed security groups:

```bash
aerolab config gcp delete-firewall-rules
```

## Other commands

All commands are supported on `aws`, `gcp` and `docker` backends and should behave exactly the same.

## Note on shared GCP accounts and KeyPairs

AeroLab creates and destroys SSH key pairs as needed. However, if
a particular cluster is created by user X, user Y can only access
the cluster if user X shares their key pair for that cluster.

By default, keys are stored in `${HOME}/aerolab-keys`.
