# [v7.5.2](https://github.com/aerospike/aerolab/releases/tag/7.5.2)

_Release Date: May 31st, 2024_

**Release Notes:**
* FIX: `grow` command for clusters and clients would not correctly inherit the expiry dates.
* FIX: AGI status and WebUI inventory would fail if not running latest aerolab version.
* FIX: Allow `upgrade` command to run without existing configuration.
* AGI: Support new graphs for `retransmits`.
* WebUI: On docker, attach was always loading gremlin console. This fix resolves the issue.
* FIX: Partitioner - mkfs - use `-F` on `ext` and `-f` on `btrfs/xfs` filesystems - lack of linux consistency.
