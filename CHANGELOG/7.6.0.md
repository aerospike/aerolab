# [v7.6.0](https://github.com/aerospike/aerolab/releases/tag/7.6.0)

_Release Date: Month Day, Year_

**Release Notes:**
* CI: Update all dependencies: brew install actions, rpm package, golang version and Packages.
* AWS: Allow aerolab to deploy in AWS using private IPs only, with public IPs disabled. Use as `aerolab config backend -t aws --aws-nopublic-ip`.
* WebUI: always show current backend in the top.
* WebUI: Add asbench ui for asbench command generation.
* Client: Add eks client - eksctl bootstrap system.
* Client: Open ports 8998 and 8182 for Vector and Graph clients.
* Upgrade: improved `aerolab upgrade --edge` - always install latest pre-release if multiple are available.
* Upgrade: added `aerolab upgrade --bugfix` - will upgrade to latest fix version, not bleeding edge version.
* Partitioner: when configuring index on device, parse partition tree sprig configs and fix if required.
* GCP: support hyperdisks and `n4` family instances
* AWS,GCP: support new format parameters `--aws-disk` and `--gcp-disk` allowing ssh-style option specification.
  * Support for all disk types, with and without provisioned Iops and Throughput.
* Client: Vector: add support for centos-stream-9 base.
* WebUI: Make `instance-type` and `zone` listings in `cluster/client create` commands a dropdown instead of freeform field.
* AGI: If timestamp is missing year, assume current year.

## TODO:

* AWS: support multiple regions as comma-separated value list.
  * Add switches to the `cluster/client/volume/agi create` commands to allow specifying the region in multi-region setups.
* WebUI: Multi-user hosted aerolab webui support.
  * Top-right job list: add "show all user jobs" switch, add username/email info of user to each job
  * Add support for special owner/user header which can be set which will define the user running the command/session itself (so can be used with authenticating proxy).
  * Change `weblog` path to `./weblog/user-owner/items.log`.
  * If `--hosted` is specified, disable local path explorer for file upload items. Instead use a file uploader plugin with temp path on the aerolab server.
  * In `--hosted` mode, `files upload/download` options allow for proxy-upload and proxy-download of files between user's browser and nodes.
  * In `--hosted` mode, for all WebUI, AGI and AGI-monitor components, to allow for shipping a signed cert and performing cert validation (do NOT ignore invalid cert).
  * In `--hosted` mode, non-AGI firewalls (cluster/client) should use per-user firewall names by default to avoid conflicts.
* WebUI: Implement `simple` mode in which the number of items/options/features is reduced, hiding the more obscure settings.
  * Provide slider for `simple/full` mode with option in the command line to disable said slider.
  * Provide sane defaults for simple mode, with option to reconfigure which options are present using a text file list of Functions and Options.
* Add support for ubuntu 24.04 (default with aerospike 7.2)

## TODO or v7.7.0 tbd

* WebUI: HA support
  * Support storing inventory and instance-types cache in a location other than local disk (aerospike DB?) for shared cache.
  * Support each aerolab generating it's own NODE-ID and storing it in a distributed DB.
    * Highest node-id wins and is the one updating the inventory in the DB, all others read the cache only.
      * Check who is highest every time reading from cache or updating.
    * Each node inserts it's node-id into a nodes set with a 30-second timeout on record, every 10 seconds.
      * If a node is not available after 30 seconds, it's entry expires and another is chosen.
