## TODO:

* WebUI: Multi-user hosted aerolab webui support.
  * Top-right job list: add "show all user jobs" switch, add username/email info of user to each job
  * Add support for special owner/user header which can be set which will define the user running the command/session itself (so can be used with authenticating proxy).
  * Change `weblog` path to `./weblog/user-owner/items.log`.
  * If `--hosted` is specified, disable local path explorer for file upload items. Instead use a file uploader plugin with temp path on the aerolab server.
  * In `--hosted` mode, `files upload/download` options allow for proxy-upload and proxy-download of files between user's browser and nodes.
  * In `--hosted` mode, for all WebUI, AGI and AGI-monitor components, to allow for shipping a signed cert and performing cert validation (do NOT ignore invalid cert).
  * In `--hosted` mode, non-AGI firewalls (cluster/client) should use per-user firewall names by default to avoid conflicts.
* WebUI: Implement `simple` mode in which the number of items/options/features is reduced, hiding the more obscure settings.
  * Provide slider for `simple/full` mode with option in the command line to disable said slider.
  * Provide sane defaults for simple mode, with option to reconfigure which options are present using a text file list of Functions and Options.
* Add support for ubuntu 24.04 (default with aerospike 7.2)
