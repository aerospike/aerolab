# TODO for 7.4.0 to be ready

* inventory volumes - GCP and AWS buttons
* inventory clusters
* inventory clients
* inventory agi - special page joining AGI volumes and AGI clusters

* Agi - after it stopped, on restart, will it remember which instance size was used for a given volume? If not, will it be aware of need to size, and will it ask the monitor to size (like a file on the volume with sizing information)?
* telemetry - report the command run properly somehow
