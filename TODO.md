# TODO for 7.4.0 to be ready

* buttons for inventory: clusters, clients, AGI
* Agi - after it stopped, on restart, will it remember which instance size was used for a given volume? If not, will it be aware of need to size, and will it ask the monitor to size (like a file on the volume with sizing information)?
* telemetry - report the command run properly somehow
* Agi - consider adding graphs for security.c log message aggregations (like warnings/errors dashboard)
