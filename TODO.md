# TODO for 7.4.0 to be ready

* AGI Details button (provide a nice way to show mapping of original->new names and other details, including errors and agi stack logs)
* attach command buttons - Cluster/Client

* AGI Improvements
  * Agi - after it stopped, on restart, will it remember which instance size was used for a given volume? If not, will it be aware of need to size, and will it ask the monitor to size (like a file on the volume with sizing information)?
  * Agi - consider adding graphs for security.c log message aggregations (like warnings/errors dashboard)

* Other
  * telemetry - report the command run properly somehow

* Full test - test all buttons in inventory listing menus; on all backends
