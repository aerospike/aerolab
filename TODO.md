# TODO for 7.4.0 to be ready

* AGI Extended action buttons (status, details, etc)
* attach command buttons
* tooltips on hover over buttons in inventory list view

* AGI Improvements
  * Agi - after it stopped, on restart, will it remember which instance size was used for a given volume? If not, will it be aware of need to size, and will it ask the monitor to size (like a file on the volume with sizing information)?
  * Agi - consider adding graphs for security.c log message aggregations (like warnings/errors dashboard)
  * Agi - provide pretty way to show old-to-new filename mapping for renamed original->new files
  * Agi - add buttons to make it possible to see logs as well? ;; how about on ttyd attach go straight to the right location where logs are, does it currently happen?

* Other
  * telemetry - report the command run properly somehow

* Full test - test all buttons in inventory listing menus; on all backends
