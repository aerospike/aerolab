#### 7.2.0
* Allow specifying aerospike version number for agi.
* Check if locked security group / firewall rule does not include current IP. In this case, attempt to fix the rule.
* Add to aerolab config backend support for AWS profile names.
* New: `aerolab cluster share` - add a userâ€™s public key option to instance (wrapper around `ssh-copy-id`).
* Expiries - add expiry information print during cluster creation.
* If expiry < 24h and attach is executed, print warning message (only on interactive shell, if `--` args are provided, do not print).
* AGI: Add notification support via https calls for status changes of AGI instances (finished ingest, sizing, logs too large, etc); with optional "fail on response error".
* Add global option `--beep` which will cause the terminal to issue a beep on aerolab exiting (finished/error task) - implements `CTRL+G` or `int(7)` terminal print.
  * The parameter can be specified multiple times. In this case, only one beep will be present on success, multiple beeps will be present on failure.
  * A `--beepf` is also added, which will only trigger beep on failures.
  * Useful for example in: `aerolab cluster destoy -f --beepf --beepf && aerolab cluster create --beep --beep` - beep twice on any failure, or once on successful completion of last command.
  * Beeps are globally configurable with environment variables `AEROLAB_BEEP=x` and `AEROLAB_BEEPF=x` where `x` is the number of beeps to apply.
* Inventory listing support `--aws-full` to print inventory in all AWS regions.
* AWS EFS volumes are supported (large cost saving and predictable IOPS on AWS platform, useful for AGI).

  * node-attach -l all -- /some/command
  * node-attach -l 1,2 -- /some/command
  * NOTE: simply doing node-attach -l 2 - will attach to bash shell on that node, as it used to. Old behaviour has not been changed 

#### 2.23
Features:
* help now supports --full flag, without which it doesn't print config file parameter examples

#### 2.22
Fixes:
* enable-xdr true matches set(s)-enable-xdr=true, which causes addition bug
* help pages should be 'comma-separated', not 'space-separated'
* it says 16.06 in help instead of 16.04
* fix error 401 on enterprise version - show actual useful error
* choosing aerolab make-xdr-clusters -c 4 -a 4 -m test,bar -d ubuntu -i 16.04 -v 4.5.0.3 causes OS version error (-d switch naming collision. Using '-x' now for xdr dc names)

Features:
* cluster-start, cluster-stop, cluster-destroy now accept multiple cluster names as comma-separated values
* cluster-start, cluster-stop, cluster-destroy now accept 'all' to affect all existing clusters
* nuke-template now accepts 'all' in distro, version and aerospike version. Set all 3 to 'all' to nuke all templates
* insert-data now allows user:password
* new version bin/osx-aio released, contains osx binary with embedded linux binary (so that insert-data works without having to specify a linux binary, seamless now)

#### 2.21
* checkUbuntuAerospikeVersion fix unchecked errors

#### 2.20
* upload had unhandled errors, fixed

#### 2.19
* insert-data fixed another unreported error
* insert-data command help updated to make it more clear

#### 2.18
* Aerospike Python client fails on ubuntu 18.04 with 'undefined symbol: OPENSSL_sk_num' error. Downgraded all client libraries to use 16.04

#### 2.17
* insert-data fixed reporting bug which would report error even if no error was present if the insert was too fast
* insert-data some errors went unreported and were treated as success, fixed

#### 2.16
* get-logs should return .log file names
* cluster-list on docker now only prints containers associated with aerolab
* added ldap deployment script and documentation on how to configure aerospike to deploy ldap
* fixed \r location on download progress report

#### 2.15
* AWS backend: make-client, net-block, net-unblock, net-list

#### 2.14
* AWS backend support - experimental, feature yet not implemented: make-client, net-block, net-unblock, net-list
* data-insert set socketTimeout to 0, timeout to 5 seconds and maxRetries to 2 to improve speed and stability
* created help for how to use AWS plugin
* fix issue with cluster-grow (bug in cluster node list count)

#### 2.13
* data inserter (auto-insert) to fill cluster quickly with data, with '-u 1' multithreading, very aggressive and best suitable for inserts up to 200'000 records at a time 

#### 2.12
* resolved issue with overlayfs (overlay bug, disabled overlayfs, lxc works again)
* made docker default throughout

#### 2.11
* modification to conf file are SHOWING \r\n INSTEAD OF JUST \n
* encryption at rest - created documentation on how to do it, provided conf template
* get-logs (download-logs, to download all node logs)
* gen-tls-certs now uses /etc/aeropsike/ssl/{TLS_NAME}/... instead of /etc/aerospike/ssl/... - in preparation for use of multiple TLS certs
* added notes on multiple certificates to the MAKETLS.md documentation file
* copy-tls-certs - copy from one node to another (or cluster->cluster)
* fixed issue with chDir
* added binutils installation as default (will now provide addr2line by default)

#### 2.10
* make-cluster: auto-workout ubuntu version required to run that version of aerospike and use that if none specified (instead of trying 18.04 everywhere)
* make-cluster: check file dir paths in template config => create dirs on the fly in container if needed
* chDir (-W) - add option to specify download path for CA cert generation and for download of aerospike tarballs

#### 2.9
* fixed: cannot use underscore '_' in cluster/client names, as this results in a container that needs to be removed with 'docker' commands
* added check in docker init() - check not only if docker exists, but also if it's running

#### 2.8
* cpu-limit, ram-limit, swap-limit implemented for docker
* *-limit example documentation
* added net-tools and vim as installed by default in each contianer
* minor error message improvements

#### 2.7
* fixed: net-list does not format correctly on docker and is slow
* feature: deploy-amc
* feature: make-cluster single-node allows to expose ports to host system

#### 2.6
* format cluster-list on docker - add IP assignment information
* make-xdr-clusters used -o in 2 places, fixed, destination-node-count switch is now -a, not -o

#### 2.5
* bug with cluster name in gen-tls-certs function
* bug with aerospike start/stop script for docker ubuntu container (no systemd)
* minor bugs and issues

#### 2.4
* added feature: aerolab upload -n CLUSTER_NAME -l NODE_LIST -i INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE
* added feature: aerolab download -n CLUSTER_NAME -l NODE_LIST -i INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE
* NOTE: upload/download small files only, this is highly inefficient as it reads a whole file to RAM before saving it

#### 2.3
* In docker, auto-fix log location of Aerospike log in aerospike.conf (no journalctl)
* If target (remote or local) is Darwin, use docker default, otherwise use LXC default
* Fixed Centos creation never finishes for template on CentOS 7
* Fixed custom startup script for Aerospike in CentOS 7 on docker (damn you, docker!)

#### 2.2
* fix: dependency check for lxc on bionic, as package names changed :)
* PART OF: docker-ce docker functionality initial EXPERIMENTAL - see FUTURE.md for known bugs
* disabling btrfs as 18.04 has broken btrfs lxc-copy: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues/2612
* enabled overlayfs in lxc mode as workaround from btrfs lxc-copy issue

#### 2.1
* fix: nuke_template test and add stop before destroy
* fix: cluster-start hangs on exit if '-l' is specified. IP assignment wait fail

#### 2.0
* Initial stable golang release
