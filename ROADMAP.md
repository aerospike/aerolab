# Roadmap

* Support for `Azure` backend.
* Add pricing information showing when creating clusters.
  * Also add pricing information to `inventory instance-types` command output.
  * Also track cost and pricing using tagging/labels and show estimated running/idling cost in `list` views.
* Add auto-cluster-expiries for cloud engines.
* Clients/Connectors - make connectors more plugin-based using deployment scripts instead of baking in deployments into aerolab.

* Consider adding log-monitoring stack (Aerospike-Grafana-Integration) command.
* Consider adding telemetry to all users (anonymous usage only).
* Consider adding option of `ansible` or other backend (gen scripts instead of performing deployments).
* Consider tailscale integration.
