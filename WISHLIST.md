# Feature wishlist

## This is a list of features requested for consideration

* AMS deployment support so that `exporter` can be auto-deployed on the nodes and an easy `make-ams` feature would deploy a container/instance with both `prometheus` and `grafana` installed
* support for running a deployment script as part of spinning up a cluster with `make-cluster` and `cluster-grow` so that e.g. `blkdiscard` can be done as part of startup automated procedure
