To try alien before installing, just run ./alien.pl from this directory. Most
features will work prior to installation.

To install alien, become root and type:
	perl Makefile.PL; make; make install

On a RPM distribution, install redo and:
        redo rpm ; rpm -ivm alien-*.noarch.rpm

To use alien, you'll need a variety of other software. See the README for
details.
