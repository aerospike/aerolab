    since v4 seem safe for alien's generated rules files.

  * Avoid uninitialized value warning when debian/rules fails to run
    due to alien being run in a noexec directory. Closes: #579216
  * Prevent DESTROY stomping on alien's exit code sometimes.
  * Support extracting lzma compressed RPMs. 
    (Patch by unnamed person on some bug tracking system I don't frequent.)
  * Suggest lzma. If not installed, alien will still fail to decompress
    RPMs using it, but will support most rpms, which are not.
  * Fix precedence problem that prevented alien from preserving permissions
    of suid/sgid binaries that are not owned by root.
    (Patch by Duane Waddle, on a bug tracking system I don't frequent, that
    was about the "expire" it 4 days from now. We got lucky Duane, but please
    use the Debian BTS next time!)

  * Simplified rules file.
  * Modify maintainer scripts from rpm files to use /bin/bash rather
    than /bin/sh. Many such scripts are only tested on systems where /bin/sh
    is bash, and contain bashisms, which can cause trouble when converting
    the rpm to be used on eg, the Debian family of distributions, where

  * Don't assume that just because we know of a user or are root, that files
    can go into the deb owned by that user, and come out right on install.
    Instead, assume that any non-root user will not be on the target system
    the rpm is installed on, and that it might be created in the preinst or
    something, so add permissions fixup code for all such users.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Feb 2003 22:51:11 -0500

alien (8.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use rpmbuild -bb instead of rpm -bb, as it seems that rpm -bb has stopped
    working in recent versions of rpm, as shipped by red hat (Debian's rpm,
    confusingly, continues to support rpm -bb, possibly because of how I hack
    its popt stuff up for debian.) This may fail with older, pre-rpmbuild
    rpm's; if so you should upgrade to a more current version I guess.

alien (8.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pach from Erwan MAS <erwan@mas.nom.fr> that allows specification of the
    version of a tgz file, for files that don't have a parseable version
    number. For consistency with --description, I made the otpino be called
    --version -- if no argument is specified to this option, it retains its
    old behavior of displaying alien's version, but it is now overloaded
    if given an argument. Closes: #165584

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Oct 2002 20:51:51 -0400

alien (8.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support inspired by aj for converted rpm packages that create
    users/groups in their preinst, and which alien therefore cannot ship the
    files with proper ownerships in the .deb. In this case alien will now
    insert appropriate chown commands into the postinst script of the
    converted package.
  * That only works when converting rpm to deb, not the other way around,
    for now.
  * Removed the cpio directory permissions fixup code, which was probably
    broken, and is obsolete since I get directory perms from the rpm now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Aug 2002 15:17:57 -0400

alien (8.19) unstable; urgency=low

alien (8.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * When converting from rpm, do parent directory 755 chmods first, then
    known permissions setting from rpm --queryformat, so that it can override
    any directories that do indeed have a permission set.

  * Support rpms with a description consisting of just blank lines.

 -- Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>  Mon,  1 Apr 2002 13:36:45 -0500

alien (8.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed an unfortunate typo in Rpm.pm, Closes: #140742

 -- Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>  Sun, 31 Mar 2002 23:05:30 -0500

alien (8.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Should avoid warning message, Closes: #140286
  * README and description updates.

 -- Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>  Thu, 28 Mar 2002 14:27:10 -0500

alien (8.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made more robust in the face of empty rpms. Closes: #138969

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Mar 2002 11:29:23 -0500

alien (8.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "vmware and dpkg on drugs" release.
  * If a preinstall script in a rpm starts like this:
    # BEGINNING_OF_POST_DOT_SH
    #!/bin/sh
    Add anther hashbang at the top, so dpkg doesn't croak on it.
    Closes: #137032

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Mar 2002 12:57:06 -0500

alien (8.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * LSB package support. It can generate LSB packages (not guarenteed
    fully conformant with the LSB), and it can take LSB packages and convert
    them into other formats. Unlike all the other conversions, lsb packages's
    dependancy (on lsb) and their package scripts are preserved in the
    generated packages (when allowed by the target package format). This means
    your distribution will need to have a package named 'lsb' for the result
    to be installable. (Debian will have one soon..)
  * Suggest rpm-lsb, which is the preferred rpm to build lsb packages with.
    Use it if it's present, plain old rpm otherwise.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Feb 2002 12:55:42 -0500

alien (7.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support ancient (bo-era) debs with upper-case field names. Closes: #130736

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jan 2002 23:38:57 -0500

alien (7.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use --target noarch instead of --target=noarch when building rpms.
    The latter used to work, but no longer does, due to some change in rpm or
    popt. It also has to come after the -bb.
  * Trap stderr of rpm and debian/rules building packages, and only display if
    the build fails.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Jan 2002 13:53:04 -0500

alien (7.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to the excellent work of Mark A. Hershberger <mah@everybody.org>,
    alien now supports converting to and from Solaris "pkg" packages (which
    are really SysV packages). You probably need to run it on Solaris for this
    to work, though. This brings the number of possible conversions alien can
    do up from 12 to a monstrous 20!
  * Mark also had to patch Deb.pm a bit so the by-hand deb extraction could
    work with solaris's ar and tar.
  * Documented the EMAIL environment variable. Closes: #116754
  * Threw out a lot of old patches, circa 1999. Probably useless today.
  * When converting to debs, move files as follows, if possible, for better 
    FHS compliance:
  	/usr/man	=> /usr/share/man
        /usr/info	=> /usr/share/info
        /usr/doc'	=> /usr/share/doc
  * Also moves files as follows, to avoid possibly confusing dpkg with
    installing over symlinks (?). Closes: #40012
        /usr/bin/X11 should be /usr/X11R6/bin
        /usr/lib/X11 should be /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
        /usr/include/X11 should be /usr/X11R6/include/X11
  * Reverse these moves in the cleantree stage.
  * Debian users who have installed alien packages in the past may want to
    re-convert and reinstall them, to take advantage of the new FHS
    conversions.

  * Moved as many system calls as I can over to shellless execution.
    There are still a lot that use shell tricks. Should deal with screwey
    rpms and file names better though. Closes: #105283
  * Display build logs after build failures.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jul 2001 10:16:20 -0400

alien (7.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Treat 'armv4l' arch rpm's as arm architecture.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2001 13:40:20 -0400

alien (7.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Raul Miller <moth@debian.org> to make it use gzip -dc | tar
    everywhere it used to use tar zxvf. The problem with the latter is
    that, on Red Hat anyway, when tar is reading from stdin, tar or gzip
    seems to be broken, and tar does not see an end-of-file marker, causing
    alien to hang when converting rpms to debs. Closes: #96200

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  9 May 2001 11:09:16 -0400

alien (7.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modification to match changes in rpm 4's parser; need to use

alien (7.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to use debhelper v3 when converting packages. This
    automatically should make it start adding ldconfig calls
    as appropriate to maintainer scripts. Closes: #86088
  * It does mean you need debhelper 3.x for alien to convert to 
    deb now, so alien-extra will need an update.
  * Rebuilt with newer perl, so it will work with newer perl (bug filed;
    this should not have been necessary).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Feb 2001 15:33:07 -0800

    no scripts.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Dec 2000 14:50:51 -0800

alien (7.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use ls -1 instead of plain ls when copying files to debian/tmp in rpm
    conversion. Since that output is grep'ed, items might have been
    accidentually excuded before (although ls seems to output one file per
    line when run inside makefiles, probably because it notices it is not
    at a tty). Anyway, I had a report that there was a problem here, and
    this should fix it.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Nov 2000 13:02:52 -0800

alien (7.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dh_perl for automatic, correct perl dependancies, Closes: #77669

    corrected.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Nov 2000 11:59:04 -0800

alien (7.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debhelper v2 for debian/rules, but not when converting 
    packages to deb format.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Sep 2000 12:36:25 -0700

alien (7.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected return code of system check.
  * Corrected logic error in relocatable rpm handling that was making
    converting such rpms not work. (Closes: #71155)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Sep 2000 16:19:22 -0700

alien (7.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a note about a sticky library dependancy issue that I can't fix.
  * Applied a patch from Chris Gorman to deal with spaces in directory
    names, spaces in conffile names (!!), and accented characters
    everywhere in deb -> rpm conversions.
  * Fixed numerous problems when converting from .deb w/o dpkg installed.
  * Fixed "2 files on 1 line" error when converting deb -> rpm.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jul 2000 15:12:08 -0700

alien (7.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed an uninitialized value when converting from a .src.rpm.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 29 May 2000 21:42:38 -0700

alien (7.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected typo that broke Deb.pm, Closes: #64559 

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 23 May 2000 19:30:04 -0700

alien (7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed all invocations of programs to be in posix-complient form. Ie,
    no options after args, so people who set POSIX_ME_HARDER can still use
    alien.
  * Bahave better if there is no /etc/mailname.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 May 2000 16:04:07 -0700

alien (7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * When reloating files from a rpm, run the mv command directly, 
    not in a subshell; this is safer especially if odd filenames are
    involved.
  * When converting from rpm, only chmod each directory once, it was doing
    it many times for some directories before.
  * Fixed chmodding to use the correct path to the directory. This fixes
    file permissions in rpm's converted to other formats, a bug introduced
    at 7.0.
  * Fixed some undefined value warnings (which pointed out real but rare
    bugs).
  * Fixed a rare, but bad little bug. If you ran alien in a directory that
    had the suid/sgid bit set (as my home directory does), and generated
    debs and probably other formats, it generated packages with the root
    directory suid/sgid.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  9 May 2000 14:13:15 -0700

alien (7.1) unstable; urgency=low

alien (6.9999) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major typo fix in Tgz.pm.
  * Fixed newlines in tgz filelist.
  * Fixed some undefined value warnings.
  * Put the rpm spec file back in. Converting the debs to rpms fails
    because rpm doesn't use the same perl include path. Bummer.
  * Fixed duplicate alien man page problem.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Apr 2000 16:12:44 -0700

alien (6.99) unstable; urgency=low

  * The great rewrite. Alien is now based on pure object oriented package
    objects. These objects can read all relevant details about a package, and
    can generate packages based on that information. Thus, converting from one
    format to another becomes a simple matter of generating one of these
    objects, pointing it at a package, mutating it into the destination
    class, and telling it to write the new package out! A basic alien can now
    be written using these objects in one "line" of perl -- in fact, here is
    one:
      perl -MAlien::Package::Deb -MAlien::Package::Rpm -e '
      	       $p=Alien::Package::Rpm->new(filename => shift); $p->unpack;
               bless($p, "Alien::Package::Deb");
               $p->prep; $p->build'
  * Almost every line of code has been rewritten.
  * Package descriptions now include a note that they were converted with
    alien. There are other numerous changes to the converted packages, for
    instance, generated .deb's now have more info in their copyright file.
  * The template files were all moved inside the objects, which is actually
    cleaner and is certainly easier to deal with.
  * Usernames are now looked up the way POSIX intended.
  * alien.1 is now generated from POD docs.
  * Alien can now convert into multiple formats at once.
  * Alien now always cleans up after failed converts, Closes: #62331
  * Alien can now be used to just install a package with no conversion.
    Closes: #53441
  * Use a Makefile.PL because that seems to make sense, which means lots of
    the build system had to be changed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Mar 2000 04:08:05 -0800

alien (6.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected a problem triggered by wordperfect's deb: rpm can't deal with
    files that have spaces, unless they are quoted. Thus, quote all filenames.
  * Handles empty directories now when converting to rpm.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jan 2000 16:25:27 -0800

alien (6.55) unstable; urgency=low

alien (6.49) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed an obsolete note from the man page.
  * Set locale to C while using rpm to pick at the .rpm file we are going to

  * Moved /usr/lib/alien to /usr/share/alien

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Nov 1999 12:42:00 -0800

alien (6.48) unstable; urgency=low

alien (6.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on cpio. It is used in the rpm unpack phase after all, since
    alien uses rpm2cpio (Closes: #38969)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jul 1999 10:57:20 -0700

alien (6.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't call dh_fixperms. As bug #36700 points out, some things you'll
    want to convert have odd permissions intentionally. I suppose this
    change will make a lot of stuff that has odd permissions accidentially
    come through with bad perms, but that's life..

alien (6.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted the rpm version test - rpm 2.92 and above need --target.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Apr 1999 13:04:03 -0700

alien (6.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes for rpm 3.0:
    - Since rpm --showrc has changed to a format that is now very 
      difficult to machine parse for the topdir value, don't. Instead,
      force rpm to output the rpm into the cirrent directory. This is
      more consistent anyway.
    - Detect rpm version and use --target or --buildarch appropriatly.
    - Fixed alien.rpm's own build process to work again (stupid macro
      substitutions...).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Apr 1999 13:20:27 -0700

alien (6.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed applix 4.4.1 menu.
  * Fixed a problem with converting relocatable packages that contained
    the directory they claimed they could relocate into. This fixes the

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Apr 1999 00:02:53 -0700

alien (6.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * You don't need to be root to run alien -g or alien -s, so disabled the
    check there.
  * Removed extraneous install -d in debian/rules template file.
  * Added support for applix 4.4.1.
  * Fixed patch support, it's been broken.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Apr 1999 19:43:51 -0700

alien (6.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't call dh_installmanpages when converting to .deb, it can do the 
    wrong thing in some instances.
  * Handling of relocatable packages was broken. (#31868) Fixed it by
    looking at the rpm PREFIXES tag.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Dec 1998 19:02:26 -0800

alien (6.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Alien can now be installed into eg, /usr/local via a PREFIX variaible
    in the Makefile, based on work by Roman Shterenzon <roman@xpert.com>.
  * Typo fix from Roman Shterenzon.
  * Moved the patch files that come with alien out of /var/lib/alien 
    into /usr/lib/alien/patches. Alien will now check both directories for
    patches, /var first.

alien (6.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * I hope this will work with i586.deb files.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Nov 1998 21:19:19 -0800

alien (6.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems perl 5.003 breaks alien, so I set up dependancies on 5.004, and
    updated documentation accordingly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Nov 1998 00:26:21 -0800

alien (6.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated urls to the alien-extra stuff, it's now hosted on Bruce S.
    Babcock's machine.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Nov 1998 00:04:53 -0800

alien (6.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exclude .Z files from compression by dh_compress when converting to .deb
    package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Nov 1998 15:54:01 -0800

alien (6.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert tar.Z files too.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Nov 1998 19:32:13 -0800

alien (6.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't fail even if dh_shlibdeps fails.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Nov 1998 21:44:32 -0800

alien (6.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hack so it'll work on packages where the upstream version doesn't
    contain any digets.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Sep 1998 18:06:13 -0700

alien (6.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with debhelper 1.1.15 so that patches arn't installed as man
    pages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Aug 1998 13:31:56 -0700

alien (6.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * When converting from .tgz files, use arch: all. Sort of a hack, but
    since we don't know what arch of stuff is in them, it's as good a 
    guess as any. This will let people use the conversion on other
    architectures. (#26253).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Aug 1998 21:57:39 -0700

alien (6.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug converting slp -> rpm, where filenames in the generated
    filelist didn't start with "/".

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Aug 1998 15:39:31 -0700

alien (6.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Die early if converting to a .deb and not root. Debhelper command will
    cause it to die later on, anyway. (#25775)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Aug 1998 17:45:38 -0700

alien (6.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't bother calling dh_strip when converting to a .deb. This has caused
    more trouble than it's worth.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Aug 1998 13:13:50 -0700

alien (6.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Will now properly convert rpm's that have things like + in their name.
    (#25656).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Aug 1998 15:09:30 -0700

alien (6.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * There was a problem converting rpm packages to tgz and slp formats (and
    to a much lesser degree converting them to dpkg format): any parent
    directories that were not in the rpm, but did have children in the rpm,
    would end up with bad permissions (700). Alien now does a smart scan to
    detect this and changes the permissions to a more sane 755.
  * When converting to slp or tgz, with -g or -s, output informative
    message, same as when converting to rpm or deb.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Jun 1998 21:06:37 -0700

alien (6.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove a junk file that crept in in the last version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Jun 1998 18:00:32 -0700

alien (6.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a short document on how to generate a diff file for use by alien.
  * Fixed a security hole in alien generated rpm files that had scripts in
    them, that could allow a user to clobber files on the filesystem. Any
    such alien generated rpm files currently in existence already contain
    this bug, so be careful with them. Such files should be rare, they have
    to be generated by "alien --to-rpm --scripts".
  * That bug is even less likely, becuase it turns out --scripts has been
    broken since alien version 6.0. Oops. Fixed.
  * --single and --description were also broken since 6.0, and are fixed 
    now.
  * It used to be that only shell scripts could be converted to rpm format,
    because of a stupid bug. Fixed.
  * There has been a change in how rpm outputs the file list for a
    relocatable package - it used to strip the prefix from each filename,
    and I could get at it in the DEFAULTPREFIX tag. Now it doesn't, and that
    tag doesn't exist. The only change I actually had to make was to make
    alien send rpm's error about DEFAULTPREFIX not being a valid tag to
    /dev/null. All the code for dealing with DEFAULTPREFIX has been left in,
    for backwards compatability.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Jun 1998 14:33:17 -0500

alien (6.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automatic installation of .tgz and .rpm files was broken.
  * Removed yet another use of tar -I.
  * Generated .slp files now properly contain filenames all starting with
    "./", just like normal Stampede packages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  9 May 1998 14:28:54 -0700

alien (6.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * New alien-extra's are available; updated the README to point to them.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  8 May 1998 23:01:37 -0700

alien (6.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Noted in README that you need bzip2 for stampede conversions.
  * For compatability with non-debian systems, don't use tar -I, pipe bzip2,
    instead.
  * Fixed Toslp.pm to generate slp packages with the correct BINFORMAT
    settings.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  7 May 1998 16:36:48 -0700

alien (6.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed -k switch (#22168).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  6 May 1998 12:22:02 -0700

alien (6.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for generating slp packages -- alien is now capable of 16
    different types of conversions!
  * Cleaned up some of Fromslp.pm.
  * Added support for converting from .slp packages that use .gz
    compression, as well as .bz2.
  * Still TODO: handling postinst script when converting to/from .slp
    packages.
  * Updated Makefile to build .slp package of alien too, it will now appear
    on alien's homepage.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  3 May 1998 12:35:45 -0700

alien (6.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for converting from v5 Stampede linux packages. Still a
    little rough and mostly untested.
  * Note that though the documentation says it can convert to Stampede
    packages as well, this isn't implemented yet. But I wanted to get a
    snapshot of my work so far out for testing by the Stampede people.
  * Changed hard links back to symlinks.
  * Got rid of standards-version in the created .deb files, that was stilly
    to have in there.
  * Standardized warnings.
  * Fixed some documentation.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  2 May 1998 21:25:05 -0700

alien (6.02) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in README (#21126).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Apr 1998 23:25:17 -0700

alien (6.01) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * alien -i was broken, now fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Apr 1998 19:03:38 -0700

alien (6.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the module interface to be much cleaner. Probably broke many
    things in the process.
  * use strict throughout.
  * It is now possible to do multiple conversions with a single run of
    alien.
  * Reworked the rules file used to convert to a debian package so it uses
    debhelper. Alien no longer uses debstd at all. Adjusted dependancies
    accordingly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Mar 1998 16:22:50 -0800

alien (5.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated standards-version.
  * Fixed how it handles symlinks so the kernel 2.1.8x symlink bug doesn't
    prevent the package from building, by using hardlinks instead.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Feb 1998 13:39:49 -0800

alien (5.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * added --description= flag, that lets the description of slackware
    packages be set.
  * Put packages converted to .deb format into a section called "alien".
  * s/kite.ml.org/kitenet.net/g

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Nov 1997 18:05:14 -0500

alien (5.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied fix to preserve modification time when converting from rpm
    format. Thanks to Oberhumer Markus <k3040e4@c210.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at>
  * Modified lsm to place alien into /pub/Linux/utils/packages.
  * Added md5sums file back in.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 22:30:29 -0400

alien (5.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debhelper to build alien (still uses debstd to convert packages).
  * Use dpkg-deb if available, instead of using ar. This fixes #12318: alien 
    can now handle old format deb files.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Sep 1997 15:52:08 -0400

alien (5.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added version info to filename of generated .tgz files.
  * Added --keep-version flag, which makes alien not increment the 
    release number/debian version number.
  * Man page fixups.
  * Fixes for epochs (for now, just remove epochs, since rpm cannot handle
    them.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Sep 1997 13:08:03 -0400

alien (5.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed binary-indep target.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Sep 1997 18:33:18 -0400

alien (5.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exit with an understandable error if we can't write to the pwd.
  * Standardized error messages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Aug 1997 20:20:18 -0400

alien (5.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reccommend rpm >= 2.4.4-2, so noarch works, and /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/
    and /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/{noarch,<arch>} exist. Fixes #12220 and #12218.
  * Escape out variables in m// and s/// operators, fixes Bug #12219.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Aug 1997 12:31:06 -0400

alien (5.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preliminary support for converting install scripts with the --scripts 
    option. We have to uuencode them for rpm's.
  * Revised documentation.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Fakeroot and sudo fixes (#11325).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Jul 1997 21:24:49 -0400

alien (5.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem converting tgz files that contained files in the install/
    directory into rpm.
  * Ok, I'll announce this version to cola, instead of 5.11..
  * Updated .lsm description.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jul 1997 13:26:13 -0400

alien (5.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Announce on cola again.
  * Added noarch support into alien.
  * Changed rpm package to noarch version.
  * Other fixes to spec file.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Only run sudo when really necessary - makes fakeroot work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  9 Jul 1997 20:58:56 -0400

alien (5.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed an error in rpm package - all symlinks were being omitted from the
    package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Jun 1997 18:23:53 -0400

alien (5.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed stupid ugly bug in last version. "=~ tr" and "= ~tr" are very
    different things!
  * Reorganized some of the code.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Jun 1997 11:57:38 -0400

alien (5.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rpm doesn't like version numbers that contain dashes, so change to
    underscores when converting to rpm. Thanks to Arne Elofsson.
  * Added some examples to the man page.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Jun 1997 23:05:51 -0400

alien (5.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use installpkg to install slackware packages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Jun 1997 17:55:51 -0400

alien (5.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * For slackware systems: added docs to README about alien-extra slackware
    package.
  * For redhat systems: include CHANGES, COPYING, lsm file in alien.rpm.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Jun 1997 13:06:40 -0400

alien (5.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added some more documentation and warnings about file ownerships getting
    screwed up if you run alien as non-root.
  * Added basic support for converting to Slackware tgz format. Mostly 
    untested. I confess, I did this just to simplify the documentation of 
    what alien can do. It was only 10 lines of code to add this, anyway. :-)
  * Had a hard drive crash and reassembled this package from bits and
    pieces. Hope it's not broken..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 31 May 1997 17:31:26 -0400

alien (5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that occurred if the full name field in the password file
    was empty, and ypmatch was installed.
  * Fixed another bug, that occurred if NIS is actually being used, where
    alien hung forever.
  * For non-debian systems, fix upgrades.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 26 May 1997 20:01:03 -0400

alien (5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * For non-debian systems: falls back to the hostname if /etc/mailname
    isn't set

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 25 May 1997 19:50:07 -0400

alien (5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turns out alien has been broken for processing slackware packages since
    version 3.0. It was leaving an /install directory behind. Fixed this.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 20 May 1997 21:10:50 -0400

alien (5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added partial support for relocatable packages: DEFAULTPREFIX is
    examined, and if set, a subdirectory by the same name is created in the 
    build directory of the package. This means relocatable packages end up
    in a sane location, not scattered in the root directory as they were
    previously.
  * Smarter guessing of patch file name to use, now looks at version number
    and revision number if neccessary.
  * Added a patch file for applix 4.3 (and one for the applix-english package).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 15 May 1997 18:35:46 -0400

alien (5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added some cautions to man page about not using alien to replace
    important packages.
  * This version will be released to the linux community at large, not just
    debian.
  * Added a README file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 7 May 1997 16:02:53 -0400

alien (4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that made alien choke on packages that had 0 for their
    release or version number.
  * Removed obsolete alien.sh from the source package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 7 May 1997 15:17:33 -0400

alien (4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * When installing deb file, alien will use --no-force-overwrite
    The idea behind this is to make it difficult to trash your debian system
    by installing alien packages that overwrite files in it. This only works 
    if you use alien --install, not if you install the resulting .deb file by
    hand. This is a temporary fix until dpkg has --force-overwrite turned
    off by default.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Apr 1997 17:03:27 -0400

alien (4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * If a package has underscores in it's name and is being converted to deb
    format, change the underscores to dashes. Thanks to  
    Robert Coie <rac@mata.intrigue.com>
  * Strip out any other disallowed characters in package name when
    converting to deb.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 4 Apr 1997 20:12:07 -0500

alien (4.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for converting deb to rpm, based on the "martian" program
    by Randolph Chung <rc42@cornell.edu>.
  * Huge reorganization, rewrite, and code cleanup.
  * As a side effect of the above, alien can also convert tgz into rpm now.
  * Use rpm -qcp to list conffiles from rpm files.
  * Reworked how conffiles are found from tar files.
  * Removed --noinstall option, changed alien to default to not installing
    generated packages, added --install option to make it install packages.
  * Removed --nopatch/--auto option, and changed patch lookup behavior. See
    the man page for an explination of the new behavior.
  * Now Recommends: dpkg-dev and make and Suggests: patch
  * Dropped feature of making slackware package install scripts into
    postinst. If there is any demand, I'll try to work this back into the
    program.
  * Rewrote most of the man page.
  * Fixed the version number so there are two digets in the minor revision 
    number.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Mar 1997 21:49:30 -0500

alien (3.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug that was preventing alien from figuring out the version number
    of a tar file. (#8284)
  * Man page fixes, related to #8284.
  * Fixed a bug, present since 3.0, which was messing up conffile detection.
  * Removed README.debian. (It just pointed users to the man page, which is
    rather pointless.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Mar 1997 14:03:04 -0500

alien (3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force package names to lowercase.
  * Fixed --noinstall option.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Mar 1997 18:35:46 -0500

alien (3.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote alien in perl.
  * Command line options can be specified in any order.
  * -ppatch will no longer work. use --patch=<patchfile> instead.
  * Improved usage help.
  * Include extended description from rpm, if available.
  * Fixed a bug with descriptions/summaries/changelogs/copyrights on rpms
    that contained the '/' character crashing alien.
  * Increment revision number of rpms when they are alianized.
  * Recommends: cpio becuase it is needed for rpm2cpio extraction.
  * Patch files do not have to be compressed.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Clean up junk files in subdirs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 7 Mar 1997 16:08:02 -0500

alien (2.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use CHANGELOGTEXT, not CHANGELOG, when querying rpm files for
    changelogs. Fixes bug #7445.
  * Modification to work with rpm verison 2.3.7. This breaks compatability
    with previous versions of rpm. Modified control file to reflect this.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Feb 1997 21:09:18 -0500

alien (2.81) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected maintainer in debian/control.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Modifications for multiple binary package support.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 7 Feb 1997 22:25:40 -0500

alien (2.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch file for Applixware.
  * I'm looking for patch files for other commercial software, to add to the
    package. If you own commerical linux software and would like to
    contribute a patch, please contact me.

  * Generated debian/rules files will no longer pass package name to debstd
    (And neither does the debian/rules file for this package.)
  * Added -s switch for low disk space situations.
  * Added -i switch to build a package but not install it.
  * Added long options (--option), as I can never remember the short ones.
  * Fixed bug in guessing name of patch file to use.
  * Fixed bug that would not let you specify a patch file in the current
    directory, or a relative path to a patch file.
  * Don't use /etc/rpmrc as an indiciation of whether rpm is present, as 
    this is a conffile, and might be deleted. Test for actual rpm binary.
  * More friendly error message if patch file is not found, suggesting that
    you try -n option.
  * Rewrote the code that figures out information about the rpm files so it
    uses rpm --queryformat to determine everything.
  * If a rpm has a changelog, add it to the end of debian/changelog.
  * Add summary to the Description: field of generated control files.
  * Add info from a rpm's copyright field to to the copyright file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Jan 1997 20:35:10 -0500

alien (2.79) unstable; urgency=low

    new maintainer to provide some fresh ideas.

 -- Christoph Lameter <clameter@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Jan 1997 10:23:21 -0800

debmake (2.76) unstable; urgency=low

  * debstd: Multi-binary support: Generate necessary subdirectories on the
    fly from files names subpackage.filename (if such files exist) to comply
    with Policy. This results in an alternate way of storing files for
    sub-package generation. Remember to erase those directories in the
    rules file if using this scheme!

 -- Christoph Lameter <clameter@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Jan 1997 09:04:21 -0800

debmake (2.75) unstable; urgency=low

  * debchange: Fix bug introduced in 2.74

debmake (2.72) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix Bug #6690: release not able to handle multiple bug numbers.

debmake (2.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * adpkg: support for virtual package recognition
  * lots of fixes to adpkg. Add functionality to figure out which installed

    information is generated for dpkg in "DEBIAN/shlibs" and a call to ldconfig
    is placed into the automatically generated postinst script.

debmake (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * new command tgzinstall: Converts / installs a Slackware .tgz package
    with dpkg using the same technique as rpminstall.

debmake (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * rpminstall : convert a package to debian (semi)sourcepackage, build it
    and install with dpkg. Does not do installation scripts right now.
    I was able to install gated like a debian package.
  * rpminstall enables a direct installation of Red Hat packages into the
    debian package maintenance system! All dpkg commands will work on it!
  * rpminstall uses debstd and thus compresses manpages + documentation and
    computes dependencies according to the libraries referenced by the 
    ELF binaries in the Red Hat package.
